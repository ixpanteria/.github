# ixpanteria

A space to learn and share best practices in data science.

## Values and workflow

Here is how the values of this project guide the choice of tools and processes -- i.e. the workflow:

* To maximize reach, most content is in English and the tools and platforms are the most popular in the data-science, e.g. GitHub, YouTube, and LinkedIn to share code, vidoes, and annoncements.
* To minimize preparation and avoid duplication the presentations are mostly made directly from markdown files.
* To maximize simplicity the topics are selected by internal consultation -- not by majority or concensus.
* To maximize accessibility, async participation is totally OK, and possible via recordings.
* To maximize attention and participation, each meetup lasts no more than 1/2 hour including at least 10' for live discussion.
* To maximize responsability, each series of meetups is led by a single person, but may deleate the responsability, and is encouraged to invite (mainly internal) contributors.
* To maximize simplicity, discoverability, and consistency, each series has all materials in a single, public repository based on a template.

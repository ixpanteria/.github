## Details

The goal of this project is to learn best practices in data science and to share them internally for professional development and externally to contribute to the data-science community.

For maximum reach it uses English and the most popular tools and platorms, e.g. GitHub, YouTube, and LinkedIn to share code, vidoes, and annoncements.

To minimize preparation it focuses on content rather than looks, so presentations are made directly from markdown files.

The topics arise from internal needs or interests. You can propose and vote for topics [here](https://github.com/ixpanteria/.github/discussions/1).

The format evolved after several iterations. It requires relatively little effort to prepare, and no-effort to participation. Async participation is totally OK and possible via recordings.

Typically, each topic is covered in a series of 1-4 meetings, each Â½ hour long (incliding 10' for open discussion).

The person leading the project may also lead and present a topic, but contributions from others are encouraged.

All the material for a series is kept in a single public repository, e.g., https://github.com/ixpanteria/testing/ with a global README in the root, and a README for each meeting in specific folders.

The structure looked like this:

```
README.md
|- meeting1/README.md
|- meeting2/README.md
|- ...
```

The global README of the series looked like this.

# ixpanteria

The goal of this project is to learn best practices in data science and to share them internally for professional development and externally to contribute to the data-science community.

## Values and workflow

Here is how the values of this project guide the choice of tools and processes -- i.e. the workflow:

* For maximum reach it uses English and the most popular tools and platorms, e.g. GitHub, YouTube, and LinkedIn to share code, vidoes, and annoncements.
* To minimize preparation it focuses on content rather than looks, so presentations are made directly from markdown files.
* The topics arise from internal needs or interests. You can propose and vote for topics [here](https://github.com/ixpanteria/.github/discussions/1).
* The format evolved after several iterations. It requires relatively little effort to prepare, and no-effort to participation. Async participation is totally OK and possible via recordings.
* Typically, each topic is covered in a series of 1-4 meetings, each Â½ hour long (incliding 10' for open discussion).
* The person leading the project may also lead and present a topic, but contributions from others are encouraged.
* All the material for a series is kept in a single public repository, e.g., https://github.com/ixpanteria/testing/ with a global README in the root, and a README for each meeting in specific folders.
